## Milestone Progress
For our milestone, we completed the layout for some of our major screens. Our main activity features a ViewPager which manages two fragments: the user's cookbook and a search feature for new recipes. The cookbook fragment contains prepopulated recipe cards, which all link to the same sample recipe when clicked. It also features a search bar and an add button, both of which are currently nonfunctional. The search fragment's current presentation and function are relatively similar to the cookbook fragment. 

One of our optional features is the camera activity. When one clicks on a recipe in one of the fragments, the details for that recipe will appear. If the user chooses the camera button, it will immediately launch the camera feature and allow the user to take a picture. The other optional feature is the share activity. Clicking on the share button will allow the user to choose if they want to share the recipe via text or email. Neither feature currently passes any information between intents.
